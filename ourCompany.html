            entrepreneurs. Guided by the leadership of Mr Ajay Mohan Jalan, Chairman of the company, it rapidly gained
            momentum and
            grew from strength to strength and expanded into the Industrial Park, Warehouse and Infrastructure
            development.
            <br><br>

            advantages and
            world-class infrastructure.

            decades. The
